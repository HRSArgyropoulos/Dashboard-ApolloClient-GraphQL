## Live deployed application

https://foodiee.vercel.app/

## Run the project locally

In Root:

- `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Inside each workspace (client/server directory) copy the contents of the .env.example file located in that directory, paste them in a new .env file and provided the enviromental variables with the appropriate values (that you were provided to run locally)
- Open a terminal and run `yarn start-client` to start client development server
- Open a second terminal and `yarn start-server` to start server in development mode
  You can skip the last two steps by opening two terminals and running two commands by opening a single terminal and running `yarn start-dev` (but this is not optimal for development purposes).
